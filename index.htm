    <p>
        Since I was 14 years old I have been playing several competitive based computer games. <br>
        I have started with moba game Dota 2, there I did not achive great results <br>
        except having fun and playing in a team.

        Two years later I have switched to FPS game CS:GO and there I gained experience<br>
        In playing different types of tournamnets and even winning some of them.

        Latlely, since I do not have enough time to spend on playing games, <br>
        I started to play another FPS game Valorant, which is also quite competitive. <br>
        The difference is that this time I am just trying to have fun time with friends, <br>
        Rather than achieve any results. <br>
        Can not picture my self without playing any game!

    <h3>Hiking.</h3>
    <p>Just recently I have found a new activity I like to do during Summer.<br>
       As you can see from the title it is Hiking.<br>
       During the Summer 2022 me and my girlfriend went to 3 different hiking places:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Repovesi National Park</li>
        <li>Teijo National Park</li>
        <li>Nuuksio National Park</li>
    </ul>
    <p>So far I am enjoying this activity and waiting for summer 2023<br>
       To visit more beatiful places in Finland as well as outside!
